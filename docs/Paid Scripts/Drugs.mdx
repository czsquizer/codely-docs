## Configuration

1. Put the script named `sqz_drugs` to your resources folder and `ensure sqz_drugs` to your server.cfg or any other start cfg file
2. Run the SQL provided file
3. Oviously configure your config by your likings 😜

## Adding plantable drug

1. Take the part bellow and duplicate it and increase its index (the number in [] )
2. You need to put the items to the database, items are located in Items table
3. The 2 props can be changed as the plant grows -> It can change its prop after the process status
4. RewardItemCount is count of item you will receive if the status and quality are 100%

```lua

## Adding "classic" drug

1. The `Config.Drugs.joint` - joint - is the item name that must be in the database and is the main product
2. In the zones, there are 2 types: Collect/Process, you can add them as much as you want to, just change the table index, type is specified in the `Action`
3. Make sure you have all the items in your databases, maily the one in 1. step, `GiveItem` and the items from `RequiredItems`

```lua

## Making drug sellable to NPC

With this part you will be able to type: `/sellItem [itemName] [itemCount]` and sell drugs to NPC. You can add as many drugs as you want to using the method bellow.

1. Duplicate the part bellow
2. Change the index, it is the name of the sold item (now it is marijuana )
3. Change all the properties of the item

```lua
    marijuana = {
        GiveBlack = true, -- If true, player will get "black_money" account
        MinimalGiveMoney = 200, -- The minimal amount of money a player will receive after selling drugs
        MaximalGiveMoney = 500, -- The maximal amount of money a player will receive after selling drugs
        SellFromPoint = vector3(62.8466,-638.6946,44.2151), -- The center sell points where the distance will be counted from
        Radius = 500.0, -- THe radiuse from a SellFromPoint player can sell items
        RejectChance = 5, -- The chance that the ped will reject offer (100/RejectChance is the chance) (now it is 20%)
        MinItemSell = 2, -- The minimal item count that will be removed from the player (if player does not have anough item, he will be charged 1 item)
        MaxItemSell = 4, -- The maximal item count that a player can get removed (same as above)
        ShouldCallPoliceAfterRejecting = true, -- If true then a police jobs will be called after rejecting
        CallPoliceAfterRejectingChange = 3, -- The chance that a police jobs will be alterted after rejecting offer (100/CallPoliceAfterRejectingChange) (now it is 33%)
        ShouldKillInTheseAreasAfterRejecting = true, -- If true than if a player is in these areas (areas where are ussualy no people) will be killed if he does not have a friend to sell with
        -- (the ped will take out a gun and Stealth Kill the player (If the palyer is not stronger :D))
        -- To not be killed in these areas there must an other player at maximal distance of 3 gta units away
        KillAreas = {
            [1] = { -- First area
                Location = vector3(-45.442,-720.8846,44.2506), -- Location
                Radius = 5.0 -- Radius
            },
            [2] = {
                Location = vector3(2.0, 2.0, 2.0),
                Radius = 4.0
            }
            -- Below you can add as much as you want but make sure it is a sequenced table otherwise it will broke
        },
        CanSellToAllPeds = true, -- If true then a player can sell items to all types of peds
        PedPlayerCanSellTo = { -- If config above then a player can sell only to these types of peds
            [GetHashKey("a_f_m_fatbla_01")] = true,
            [GetHashKey("a_f_m_fatwhite_01")] = true,
            -- Below you can add as much ped types as you want, but make sure it is a hash
        },
        SellAnimation = {
            AnimDict = "mp_common", -- Animation directory for current animation
            AnimName = "givetake1_a", -- The animatino name
            Duration = 3000, -- Set to 0 to disable animations
            blendInSpeed = 8.0,
            blendOutSpeed = 8.0,
            AnimFlag = 1,
            MythicProggbarLabel = "Selling drug" -- The label which will be show in the progress bar
        }
    }
```

## Making drug sellable to "friends"

WIth this part you will be able to go to the phone cabin, choose how many drugs you wanna sell, then a friend will come for you and you will sell the drug for you -> the friend is NPC. You can add as much locations as you want to using the method bellow.

1. Add phone cabin to the config by duplicating the part bellow
2. Have all the drugs in the database
3. Set all the properties to your likings

## Making drug sellable by delivering

With this part you will be able to sell drugs using car and delivering drugs (items) to check points. You can add as much locations as you want to using the method bellow.

1. Duplicate the part bellow
2. Add as many delivery locations as you want to
3. Configure all the properties as you want to
4. Make sure all the items are in the database

```lua
    {
        Locations = {
            {
                Pos = vector3(1293.5991,1384.7307,101.4545), -- First delivery location
                used = false, -- Do not touch this, you do not need to :)
                Min = 10, -- The minimal amount in math.random a player will deliver
                Max = 20 -- The maximal amount in math.random a player will deliver
            },

                Min = 10, -- The minimal amount in math.random a player will deliver
                Max = 20 -- The maximal amount in math.random a player will deliver
            },
            {
                Pos = vector3(1110.6906,2098.6851,53.1546), -- Third delivery location
                used = false, -- Do not touch this, you do not need to :)
                Min = 10, -- The minimal amount in math.random a player will deliver
                Max = 20 -- The maximal amount in math.random a player will deliver
            }
        },
        Items = {'joint', 'water'}, -- The items allowed to be sold here
        MaxSellCount = {50, 15}, -- Max item sold count for each item (first item must be first count here)
        MinSellPrices = {10, 20}, -- Min price for currectly sold item (first item must be first number here)
        MaxSellPrices  = {15, 20}, -- Max price for each item (first item must be first number here)
        CarSpawnLoc = vector3(1367.5193,1138.7201,113.759), -- The spawn and return location of the vehicle
        CarSpawnHeading = 69.0, -- The heading of the spawned car
        CarProps = { -- Bellow you can set the vehicle properties which will be aplied to the vehicle
            plate = 'BURRITO',
            color1 = 27
        },
        CarModel = "burrito", -- Model name of the car
        PayForTruck = 100, -- The money a player will need to pay on the start (maybye for the car)
        ReturnTruck = 100, -- The money a player will receive when he returns the vehicle
        GiveBlack = true, -- If a player should get black money on delivery
        -- Start location

        StartLocation = vector3(1390.1125,1132.0562,114.3345), -- The location you will see the marker
        -- Markers
        Size = {x = 1.0, y = 1.0, z = 1.0}, -- Size of the marker
        Color = {r = 255, g = 255, b = 0}, -- Color of the marker
        MotionText = "[E] Call", -- The label which will be shown on the Draw3DText
        Marker = 22, -- The marker ID
        UseInovativeMarkers = true, -- If the help text should look "different", image in the forum
        DrawInovativeMarkersRadius = 5.0, -- The distance a player can see the marker from
    }
```

## Adding blackshops

Again you can add as many blackshops as you want to. Here you will be able

1. Duplicate the part bellow
2. Configure the shop items. If it is weapon and you wanna add it as `xPlayer.addWeapon` , make sure you set `weapon = true`
3. Make sure all the items are in the database.

## Adding simple sell points

This is for selling items just by clicking items in the menu, there is one simple animation, nothing "pog", you can sell items and weapons.

1. Duplicate the part bellow
2. Change the item properties, if it is weapon or not (if it is weapon, it is check if `xPlayer.hasWeapon`, not if `xPlayer.getInventoryItem`)
3. Set all the other parts to whatever you want to.

## Common errors

- `nil ESX` it seems that you have changed events by anticheat so make sure to change them in your config files of the script -` attempt to call a nil value (field ‘canCarryItem’)` - most likely you are using old version of esx < 1.2. You need to change CanCarryItem function in server/edit.lua to the following
- `attempt to call a nil value (field 'showNotification')` - Replace showNotification function for the one provided bellow
